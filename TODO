- Missing blob issue:
    What if we 'exported' pure two-way diff patches for packaging?

- Make flow chart documentation for each workflow
    - Packaging
    - Refreshing all patches
        * 3way merge conflict
        * 2way merge conflict
    - Adding a new patch
    - Removing a patch

- Should the sync command know about ``git``?
    - Maybe ``zply-commit`` should be the only part that understand git.

DOCS
- Add man git-zply for workflow documentation (use <file>.5)

WISHLIST
- Allow patch-repo to specify a COMMIT_MSG_TEMPLATE file
    - Abort if template is not filled in

CLEANUP
- Remove python dependencies (just bash)
- Better handle trailing-whitespace fixup (sed?)

TESTING
    - Add test-harness for diff
    - Add test-harness for fixup
