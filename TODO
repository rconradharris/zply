- Should the sync command know about ``git``?
    - Maybe ``zply-commit`` should be the only part that understand git.

DOCS
- Add man git-zply for workflow documentation (use <file>.5)

WISHLIST
- Allow patch-repo to specify a COMMIT_MSG_TEMPLATE file
    - Abort if template is not filled in

CLEANUP
- Better handle trailing-whitespace fixup (sed?)
