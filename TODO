- Missing blob issue:

    Observation: the missing blob issue is a consequence of how git implements
    3way merge. If we want to retain the convenience of it, we just have
    accept that some merge conflicts will be non-deterministic.

    However, packagers should not have to accept that: they shouldn't care
    about merges at all.

    The solution is to *export* a single, plain diff file against a project,
    which will be guaranteed to apply cleanly.

    The name of the diff would have the commit-hashed that it was based on, so
    people receiving the patch know which *upstream* commit it will apply
    cleanly to. For example:

    842.<hash>.diff

- Make flow chart documentation for each workflow
    - Packaging
    - Refreshing all patches
        * 3way merge conflict
        * 2way merge conflict
    - Adding a new patch
    - Removing a patch

DOCS
- Add man git-zply for workflow documentation (use <file>.5)

WISHLIST
- Allow patch-repo to specify a COMMIT_MSG_TEMPLATE file
    - Abort if template is not filled in

CLEANUP
- Remove python dependencies (just bash)
- Better handle trailing-whitespace fixup (sed?)

TESTING
- Add test-harness for diff
- Add test-harness for fixup

SCREENCAST
- Show basic workflow
